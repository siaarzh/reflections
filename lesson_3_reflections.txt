When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Anytime I want to collaborate, share, backup my source code. It is also
    essential for CI/CD.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Ideally, it would be great if changes were pulled automatically, but
    that they always alert me and go through build tests beforehand. But when
    I work on a piece of code I would like to work on it in peace before any
    other changes are pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    All three are methods to copy a code and work on it without modifying the
    original source.

    Forks - When I need to work on an existing OSS project to contribute or
    make my own version, but still reference the original creator.
    Clones - When I want to edit a project from github on my own machine or
    production machine.
    Branches - (on same machine) When I'm working on a single project and want
    to debug and add features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
