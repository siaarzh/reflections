When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Anytime I want to collaborate, share, backup my source code. It is also
    essential for CI/CD.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Ideally, it would be great if changes were pulled automatically, but
    that they always alert me and go through build tests beforehand. But when
    I work on a piece of code I would like to work on it in peace before any
    other changes are pulled.
